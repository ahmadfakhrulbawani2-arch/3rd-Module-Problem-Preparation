# 3rd Module Problem Preparation

## About this
- So this repo is apparently a set of problemset solution from my 3rd module of basic programming study. You can open the problem in PDF folder but most of them are in Bahasa Indonesia, so you need to translate it first.
- There's 11 problemset and I can only solve 10 of them. The "AM" problem can't be solved due to problemset errors (apparently there's no sufficient information in the PDF).
- I'm not making the problem, it's from my college mentor btw. I only solve it as the preparation.

## Running Instruction
1. Compiling (use minGW64 or others supported compiler)

```

For CPH Judge:
1. Install CPH judge extensions
